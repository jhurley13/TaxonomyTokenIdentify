 and other open water dependent birds were forced south early, and any lingering migrants that may have otherwise survived into the december 119th count period were forced out or perished.</br>but as we give talks about the amazing uses of the cbc for conservation research, it has become apparent that many christmas bird count participants themselves don’t realize the importance of what their contributions mean to further the protection of the birds we love!  audubon has won the hearts of the scientific community, and now we need to better communicate that fact to the universe of cbc birders themselves.</br>the 119th christmas bird count, despite some significant obstacles thrown in our way by both mother nature (but what else is new) and the united states federal government (more on that later, of course), in the end result again broke records across the board!  while the weather continentally for much of the count period was quite favorable, only lapsing into true winter toward the turn of the new year, it was the fall season leading up to the 119th count period that played a major role it this season’s results.</br>christmas bird counters are a persistent and enthusiastic bunch however, and despite the challenges again a new record high number of christmas bird counts is included in this season’s results—an amazing 2615 cbcs, 30 higher than the 118th prior record number of 2585.  of that new record total, 460 counts are included from canada, 1974 from the united states, and 181 from the caribbean, latin america, and pacific islands.  one reason the number of counts included is because of an impressive roster of new circles included this season, and table 1 lists all 51 new christmas bird counts in the 119th cbc (9 from canada, 20 from the u.s., and an amazing 22 new counts from latin america and the caribbean).</br>additionally, the importance of birding and ecotourism in some regions cannot be understated. pristine areas loaded with birds and other amazing wildlife both in tropical lowlands and high mountainous regions are under pressure for economic, extractive development. engaging local groups in ecotourism in these regions through activities like the christmas bird count is a crucial step toward the long-term protection of such regions.</br>similarly, there was no major southward raptor movement during the 119th count.  gyrfalcons were tallied, mostly as singletons, on only a few of the more northern counts.  rough-legged hawks were found in good numbers on northern cbcs, but made no significant southward movement.  there were good, though not exceptional, numbers of snowy

 at hamilton, ontario, was new to the all-time canadian species list.  as happens each season, we all head into the field in the hopes of finding as many species as possible on count day, and table 3 lists the circles blessed with enough geographic and ornithological diversity to tally 150 or more species in the 119th christmas bird count.  topping the list once again among the 84 on the list from the united states and canada is matagorda county-mad island marsh, texas at 237 species, and yanayacu, napo, ecuador retains top billing at 491 species of the 48 counts exceeding 150 species in latin america.</br>over the past 30-plus years audubon has worked to convince ornithological researchers that the christmas bird count, as well as the breeding bird survey and other community science programs, provide important and valuable data otherwise unavailable for their studies.  this endeavor has been successful beyond our wildest dreams, and the cbc and bbs databases have led the way within scientific research teams to the acceptance of the value of community science programs and data sets beyond ornithology.  supplying cbc data to researchers is now an integral part of the work the audubon science team does on a weekly basis, both within and beyond this organization.</br>christmas bird count data were used to document the shifting of ranges of birds during the early winter over the latter half of the 20th century as continental conditions moderated during that half decade.  this data enabled audubon to use the cbc as non-breeding season data with the breeding bird survey as breeding season data to produce the ground-breaking 2014 birds and climate change report, which was the first predictive modeling of where birds may need to move in the face of climate change over the next century. this october, audubon released an updated and vastly improved version of the study—survival by degrees: 389 bird species on the brink. survival by degrees incorporates far more bird data than was possible for the 2014 study, as well as including the effects of habitat changes, urbanization, sea level rise, and other potential threats into the models.  interested people can select their location by state/province or zip code and will get tailored lists of species of birds in their area with specific predictions and threats listed out.  while seeming to present dire predictions, the report also supplies information that will help the public address the effects of climate change, and also presents hope that the future can be brighter if we all take action.</br>birds are our passion, and provide the catalyst to get us out in nature, whether on a christmas bird count or at any time of year.  christmas bird counts and other traditional locations we visit also enable us to develop a sense of place, and of noticing changes and caring about that place.  being out birding also enables us to have other experiences in nature—like finding a surprise life form, whether it’s a salamander or a bobcat or an ancient tree.  and our passion for the birds and the locations where we bird encourages us to take steps to protect those birds, and the places they need.</br>back in rhode island last season, yes indeed, the

 was back for its 17th winter at ninigret national wildlife refuge.  now probably well over 20 years old, this bird knows its spot, its cove, its rock.  we’ve tallied that bird on that rock in that cove for almost half the span of the decades i’ve done that cbc.  it’s become an expected highlight of my annual cbc there.  but sometimes the real highlight isn’t a bird; as we learn our areas on christmas bird counts we gain a real sense of place about the region as well as the birds that may be found there.  during the 119th count the surprise of the season for me was found in a recently mowed field in an inland area, one we always check for interesting sparrows, maybe a sapsucker, or if we’re really lucky a

.  as i looked where i was stepping in the lumpy field i notices something curled up under a clump of grass that had been pulled up by the mowing—to my surprise and shock, a marbled salamander!  not just any salamander (which in itself would be incredibly unusual on a cbc in new england) and not what might have been more relatively expected spotted salamander, but a marbled salamander, the first i’ve ever seen north of the mid-atlantic states.  clearly the salamander wasn’t prepared for the coming winter above the surface of the ground in rhode island, so we carefully found a spot under a log in a thicket area where, hopefully, it could survive the winter after being rudely turned up by the field mowing.</br>let’s talk about the

 was tested by many local raptors, including red-tailed hawks, and disappeared for a while, only to be re-discovered in a city park in downtown portland, maine.  this is where it remained, feeding on a bumper crop of local gray squirrels, through the 119th cbc period, and was then tallied on the portland cbc.  not surprisingly, given that this high-spirited tropical raptor is not physically adapted to the freezing temperatures of northern winters, it did not fare well and was eventually found injured and taken to a rehabilitation facility.  unfortunately the bird’s legs and feet had major frostbite damage, and it eventually lost its battle to those injuries.</br>the increasing coverage of the christmas bird count program in latin america is especially encouraging. while the vast majority of cbcs are conducted in the united states and canada, the new frontier for counts is in central and south america. not only is it important to expand knowledge about the status and distribution of the resident local avifauna, but for some migrant species it is becoming a high priority to learn where and how many of the neotropical migrant species that breed in canada and the united states are wintering.  while doing christmas bird counts in the andes or tropical rainforests it’s always a treat to see the local celebrities—quetzals, harpy eagles, or mountain-tanagers—but it’s equally important to appreciate the birds that breed in our own back yards and forests that we tally. blackburnian, golden-winged, and blackpoll warblers, swainson’s and wood

 on a cbc in connecticut…or a barrow’s goldeneye in barrow (now utqiaġvik) alaska.  but then again, these days who knows might show up somewhere.</br>the shut-down posed a major impediment to the christmas bird count because many cbcs are conducted on federal property, including national wildlife refuges and national parks.  many compilers of these counts are required to have federal employees along while on the property, especially if special arrangements have been made to access areas generally not available to the birding public.  many such counts are run on weekdays just for this reason; refuge and park personnel participate as part of their work day, and when they were furloughed it was not possible to obtain their services.  additionally, if the park or refuge was gated, with the shut-down access was completely lost. many important and long-standing cbcs scheduled for the second half of the 119th count period were either run with minimized coverage or needed to be cancelled outright.</br>aside from the usual draw of a great day of birding, with hopes of finding some unusual or at least interesting birds, one of the factors that drew folks into the field for the 119th cbc was the hope of a decent winter finch flight during the season.  the “finch forecast” released in the fall of 2018 gave the potential for a good incursion of redpolls, crossbills, and winter grosbeaks southward into some more southern areas than usual.  however while there were good numbers of such birds in their more usual northern haunts, much of the lower two-thirds of north america was left out of the flight, at least for the more sought-after species like

, which will not return for another season.  yet this hawk gives us hope as birders that some other crazy bird will grace our presence during a christmas bird count or just while we’re out birding, and that sighting will help us understand what’s going on in the bird world, which deeply reflects what’s going on in our own world.
given all the relatively good weather during much of the 119th count period, all the new counts included, and the all-time high number of cbcs this season, it’s no surprise that we achieved a new record high level of participation in the 119th count:  the efforts of 79,425 observers are included this season, just shy of the 80 thousand milestone and 2500 or so more than last season’s then-record high.  included in that lofty record total are 14,816 observers from canada (11,121 the field and 3695 at feeders), 60,392 from the united states (53,828 afield and 6564 at feeders), and 4217 (4023 in the field and 194 at feeders) in latin america, the caribbean, and the pacific islands.  as expected, all those counts in the 119th cbc with all those attending participants should generate an impressive list of circles with 100 or more observers, and table 2 presents that roster of 84 circles in the 119th christmas bird count in the century-plus number of observers club.
then, smack in the middle of the 119th cbc, the united states government shut-down began at midnight on saturday, december 22nd.</div>
